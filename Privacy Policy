## 7. Data Retention
The specific personal information we process and our reasons for doing so often vary depending on how you use the Services. Therefore, the length of time that we retain personal information can also vary. We generally retain personal information for as long as we reasonably need it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (such as complying with our legal obligations, where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so, managing internal records, enforcing our contracts and terms, fraud prevention, resolving disputes, and for safety reasons), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

The primary factors we consider in determining retention periods can include minimum requirements under applicable law, relevant industry standards, the types of data in question (such as its level of sensitivity), relevance to potential litigation or similar proceedings (such as defending ourselves against legal claims), and whether the personal information is required to prevent fraud or similar abuse of the Services (including to enforce prohibitions against cheating and other unauthorized behavior and to prevent banned players from using the Services).
